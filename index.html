      <p>
        In software development and product management, a user story is an
        informal, natural language description of features of a software system.
        They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a
        system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally
        in project management software.[1] Depending on the project, user
        stories may be written by different stakeholders like client, user,
        manager, or development team.
      </p>

      <p>
        User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking
        and communication; and may help software teams document their
        understanding of the system and its context.

      <h2>History</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          1998: Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and
          coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
          1999: Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme
          Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP),and the
          usage of user stories in the planning game.
        </li>
        <li>
          2001: Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story
          creation:
        </li>
        <li>
          2001: The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format
          and shared examples with others.
        </li>
        <li>
          2004: Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the
          usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software
          Development that is now considered the standard reference for the
          topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the
          inventor of user stories. While Davies was a team
          member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the
          invention.
        </li>
        <li>
          2014: After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014
          Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends
          to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user
          stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to
          their interdependence.
        </li>
      </ul>
   
  

    <p>User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.</p>
